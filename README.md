<h1>Aquatic Animal Detection Using Faster R-CNN</h1>

<p>This project implements Faster R-CNN for detecting and classifying aquatic animals, such as fish, sharks, and stingrays, in images. The model is trained to identify objects in underwater images and draw bounding boxes around them.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Object detection using <strong>Faster R-CNN</strong>.</li>
  <li>Identification of multiple aquatic species in a single image, such as fish, sharks, and stingrays.</li>
  <li>Visualization of bounding boxes around detected objects.</li>
  <li>High-performance image classification using deep learning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dataset</h2>

<p>The dataset consists of images containing various aquatic animals, with annotations for each object. These images are used to train the Faster R-CNN model to detect and classify the animals.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>torchvision</code> (for the Faster R-CNN model)</li>
  <li><code>torch</code> (PyTorch framework)</li>
  <li><code>matplotlib</code> (for visualizing results)</li>
  <li><code>opencv-python</code> (for image preprocessing)</li>
</ul>

<p>Install the dependencies using:</p>

<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>

<h2>Model Architecture</h2>

<p>This project utilizes the <strong>Faster R-CNN</strong> architecture, a state-of-the-art object detection model that detects objects in an image and classifies them. Faster R-CNN is particularly suitable for tasks like this, where multiple objects of different categories need to be identified in a single image.</p>

<h2>Training</h2>

<p>The model is trained on a dataset of annotated underwater images, where each image contains multiple objects (e.g., fish, sharks, stingrays). The training process involves fine-tuning the Faster R-CNN model on the specific dataset to ensure high detection accuracy.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The project evaluates the model’s performance by detecting and classifying animals in test images. Bounding boxes are drawn around detected objects, and labels are assigned based on the model’s predictions.</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>

<p>You can adjust the following aspects of the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dataset</strong>: Use a different dataset containing other types of aquatic or non-aquatic animals.</li>
  <li><strong>Model</strong>: Experiment with other object detection models such as YOLO or SSD for comparison.</li>
  <li><strong>Hyperparameters</strong>: Tune the learning rate, number of epochs, and other parameters to improve model performance.</li>
</ul>
